# Neovim Config

This is my personal Neovim configuration, designed specifically for general text editing. It's built on top of lazy.nvim for plugin management and includes a selection of plugins to enhance productivity and user experience.

## Plugin Manager

This configuration uses [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) as its plugin manager. All plugins are defined in the `lua/plugins/` directory.

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository to your Neovim configuration directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gilang-arya/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
    ```
2.  Start Neovim. `lazy.nvim` will automatically install all the plugins.
